Algorithm: Finding Available Meeting Slots

This algorithm focuses on identifying available meeting slots for two individuals based on their daily schedules and activities. 

The key inputs are:
  1. Person1_Schedule: A list of time slots indicating when Person 1 is available.
  2. Person1_DailyAct: A list of planned engagements for Person 1 when they are busy.
  3. Person2_Schedule: A list of time slots indicating when Person 2 is available.
  4. Person2_DailyAct: A list of planned engagements for Person 2 when they are busy.
  5. Duration: The required length of the meeting in minutes.

The algorithm guarantees that it finds all overlapping time slots that accommodate the specified meeting duration, provided the schedules are accurate and non-overlapping. It iteratively checks each person's availability against their daily activities, ensuring efficient and accurate scheduling.
