Algorithm 2: Greedy Approach to Hamiltonian Problem

This algorithm focuses on identifying the optimal starting city given that the cities are arranged in a circl and each city has a gas station. 
The key inputs are:

1. city_distances: the distances between neighboring cities

2. fuel: the fuel available at each city's gas station

3. mpg: the miles per gallon the car travel

The algorithm guarantees that there is exactly one valid starting city from which you can complete the loop and return without running out of fuel.
